## Android-Localization-Helper
A small java library / executable that fixes borken indexes after translating an xml from google translate.

## Why this project?
Being an indie developer for apps, you may not have the budget for a high quality translation while localizing your app, hence you may have to rely on online services such as google translate or bing. However, if you have a large amount of strings in your app, you may not have have the luxury for a string by string translation. To fix that issue, you could put your strings in a document and get it translated on google translate. However, that creates the following problem:

This library/executable would help you fix that issue by picking the source string (your english/ default string) and then the string to fix. The library will take care of the rest. 

## Note: it is a good idea to create a backup before you start.
